        Hi! I am a first year Data Science Master's student at the University of California, San Diego. 
		I have developed strong technical, communication, organizational, and project management skills through diverse research and professional experiences. Leveraging my multicultural background, I am passionate about making Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence technologies accessible to communities worldwide.
		<br>
    	In my free time, I like to knit and crochetðŸ§¶ I find the process of making garments very stimulating for my brain!
