            Hi! I am a first-year Data Science Master's student at the University of California, San Diego. 
            I have developed strong technical, communication, organizational, and project management skills through diverse research and professional experiences. Leveraging my multicultural background, I am passionate about making Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence technologies accessible to communities worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I like to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/miz__knits/">knit and crochetüß∂</a>. I find the process of making garments very stimulating for my brain! I also love to explore the city of San Diego, finding new restaurants and shops!
